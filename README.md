- **Village**: The village the character belongs to.

- **Affiliation**: Whether they belong to a specific group like Anbu, Root, Akatsuki, Rogue Ninja, etc.
- **Chakra Nature**: One or two random chakra natures.
- **Skills**:
  - Taijutsu
  - Ninjutsu
  - Genjutsu
  - Chakra Amount
  - Chakra Control

Additionally, the application allows you to download the generated card in PNG format.

### Add New Functionalities
