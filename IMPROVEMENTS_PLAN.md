# Implementation Plan for Future Improvements

This document outlines the plan for implementing the suggested improvements for the Naruto Character Card Generator, ordered from the most feasible/easiest to the most complex.

## 1. Jutsu Generator

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Description:** Add a new section to the character card that displays a list of random jutsus based on the character's chakra nature.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  In `script.js`, create a new function called `generateRandomJutsus(chakraNatures)`.
2.  Inside this function, create a mapping of chakra natures to a list of corresponding jutsus.
3.  The function should return a few random jutsus based on the input `chakraNatures`.
4.  In the `generateCharacterCard()` function, call `generateRandomJutsus()` and display the result in a new `<p>` element on the card.

## 2. Card Customization

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Description:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the character card, such as the color scheme or font.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  In `index.html`, add new UI elements (e.g., color pickers, dropdowns for fonts) for customization.
2.  In `script.js`, add event listeners to these new UI elements.
3.  When a customization option is changed, update the corresponding CSS variables or apply new CSS classes to the character card elements.

## 3. Custom Stats

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Description:** Allow users to manually set the character's stats instead of generating them randomly.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  In `index.html`, add input fields (e.g., range sliders or number inputs) for each stat (Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, etc.).
2.  In `script.js`, when the "Create Character" button is clicked, read the values from these input fields.
3.  Pass these values to the `createProgressBar()` function to generate the progress bars with the custom stats.

## 4. Image Upload

**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard

**Description:** Allow users to upload an image for their character to be displayed on the card.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  In `index.html`, add a file input element (`<input type="file">`).
2.  In `script.js`, add an event listener to the file input.
3.  When a file is selected, use the `FileReader` API to read the image as a data URL.
4.  Create an `<img>` element on the character card and set its `src` to the data URL.

## 5. Save and Load Characters

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Description:** Implement a feature to save generated characters to the browser's local storage and load them later.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  When a character is generated, create an object containing all its data (name, village, stats, etc.).
2.  Add a "Save" button to the card. When clicked, store the character object in `localStorage` (you might need to `JSON.stringify` it).
3.  Create a new "Load Characters" button or a dedicated section to display saved characters.
4.  When the "Load Characters" button is clicked, retrieve the character data from `localStorage`, parse it, and regenerate the cards.

## 6. Character Gallery

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Description:** Create a gallery to display all the saved characters.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  This feature builds upon the "Save and Load Characters" functionality.
2.  Create a new section in `index.html` for the gallery.
3.  When a character is saved, also add it to the gallery section.
4.  The gallery should display a small preview of each card, and clicking on a preview could show the full card.

## 7. Team Generator

**Difficulty:** Very Hard

**Description:** Add a feature to generate a team of 3-4 ninjas with balanced skills.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  Create a new UI for generating a team.
2.  When the "Generate Team" button is clicked, loop 3-4 times to generate multiple characters.
3.  Implement a balancing algorithm to ensure the team has a mix of skills (e.g., one sensor type, one heavy hitter, one medical-nin).
4.  Display the generated team members together.

## 8. Character Battles

**Difficulty:** Very Hard

**Description:** Create a simple battle system where two generated characters can fight against each other based on their stats.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  Create a new UI for the battle system, with slots for two characters.
2.  Allow users to select two generated (or saved) characters to battle.
3.  Define a battle logic. For example, you could compare the stats of the two characters and use some randomness to determine the outcome of each "turn".
4.  Display the battle log and the final winner.
